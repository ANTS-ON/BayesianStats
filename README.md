Bayesian Statistics from Scratch
---

Short introduction to Bayesian statistics with a script and some exercises.

### Installation
In order to execute the script and do the exercises, you need a virtual environment with several packages (`jupyter`, `pymc`, ...). You can simply create the environment by creating a virtual environment and installing packages from the `requirements.txt`.
```shell
python -m venv <env_name>
source <env_name>/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Within this conda environment, just start a jupyter notebook server by
```shell
jupyter notebook
```
This should open an interactive view in your standard browser. From your browser, you can work on exercises and look at the interactive script.
